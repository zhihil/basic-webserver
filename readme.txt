The code is largely based on code from Ruslan's wonderful blog, which has a 
3-part tutorial on WSGI web servers in Python. The guide tackles:

    - (Part 1) - The basics of what a webserver is
    - (Part 2) - WSGI and how you can mix-and-match frameworks and servers 
                    that weren't explicitly designed to work together.
    - (Part 3) - Basic concurrency and serving multiple users.
    - (Part 3) - Resolving duplicate file descriptors and zombie processes
                    that eat up available resources for your web server.
